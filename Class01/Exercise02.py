# 1. Create a list with at least three numbers on it
a = [123, 456, 789]

# 2. Compare the first and last number in your list and store the resulting boolean in a variable
b= a[0] < a [2]

# 3. Write an if statement that uses your boolean from step 2. If it's true print out a happy message otherwise print out a sad one.
if b:
    print('congrats')
else:
    print('false')
